# Natural Language Processing Specialization

This Coursera Specialization course will equip you with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to build cutting-edge NLP systems. By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots.

## Course 1: Classification and Vector Spaces in NLP

This is the first course of the Natural Language Processing Specialization.

**Week 1: Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets**

- Use a simple method to classify positive or negative sentiment in tweets

**Week 2: Na√Øve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets**

- Use a more advanced model for sentiment analysis

**Week 3: Vector Space Models**

- Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships

**Week 4: Word Embeddings and Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation**

- Write a simple English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbors search
